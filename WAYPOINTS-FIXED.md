# ✅ FIXED! Draggable Waypoints Now Visible

## Problem Identified

The draggable waypoints weren't showing because the Canvas was using `type: "smoothstep"` for edges, but the edge type mapping was pointing to the old `RelationshipEdge` component instead of the new `OrthogonalRelationshipEdge`.

## Solution Applied

Updated `/client/src/components/Canvas.tsx`:

```typescript
const edgeTypes = {
  relationship: OrthogonalRelationshipEdge,
  step: OrthogonalRelationshipEdge,
  smoothstep: OrthogonalRelationshipEdge, // ← NOW USES ORTHOGONAL EDGE!
};
```

## What You'll See Now

Every relationship edge will have **1-2 visible draggable circles (waypoints)**:

```
Example edge with 2 waypoints:

┌──────────┐
│  Order   │───●───┐  ← Waypoint 1 (visible, draggable)
└──────────┘       │
                   ●  ← Waypoint 2 (visible, draggable)
                   │
              ┌────▼────┐
              │ Customer│
              └─────────┘
```

## Features

✅ **Always Visible** - Waypoints show on every edge immediately  
✅ **1-2 Points** - Simple, not cluttered  
✅ **Draggable** - Click and drag anywhere  
✅ **90° Angles** - Maintained automatically  
✅ **Auto-Save** - Changes persist to database  
✅ **Visual Feedback**:
  - White circles with colored borders
  - Inner colored dots
  - Highlights on hover
  - Fills with color when dragging
  - Drop shadows for depth

## How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:5000
2. **Look at any relationship edge** between nodes
3. **You should see 1-2 visible circles** on each edge
4. **Click and drag** a circle to move it
5. **Watch the edge path update** in real-time with 90° angles

## Visual Design

Each waypoint:
```
Normal:    Hover:     Dragging:
  ⚪         ⚪           ⚪
 (8px)     (9px)      (10px)
           larger      filled
```

- **Outer circle:** White with colored border (2.5px)
- **Inner dot:** Small colored circle (3px radius)
- **Shadow:** Drop shadow for 3D effect
- **Cursor:** Changes to "grab" on hover, "grabbing" while dragging

## Edge Path Logic

The `getOrthogonalPath` function:
1. Takes source/target coordinates and positions
2. Checks if user has defined waypoints
3. If waypoints exist: Uses them (limit 2 max)
4. If no waypoints: Auto-generates 2 default waypoints
5. Returns path + draggable waypoints array
6. Waypoints are rendered as always-visible circles

## Expected Behavior

### On New Edges
- Automatically creates 2 default waypoints
- Positioned at logical locations based on node arrangement
- Immediately visible and draggable

### On Existing Edges
- Loads waypoints from database (if saved)
- If no waypoints saved: Creates 2 default ones
- Maximum 2 waypoints maintained

### When Dragging
- Circle enlarges slightly
- Fills with edge color
- Path updates in real-time
- Maintains 90-degree angles at all corners
- Saves to database on mouse release

## Troubleshooting

### Still don't see waypoints?
1. **Hard refresh:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Clear cache:** Open browser DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
3. **Check console:** Look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify edge exists:** Make sure you have at least one relationship between nodes

### Waypoints too small?
They're 8px radius by default. They enlarge to 10px when dragging. This is intentional for a clean look.

### Path looks wrong?
The orthogonal routing algorithm automatically calculates the best path with 90-degree angles. Drag the waypoints to adjust manually.

## Server Status

✅ **Server running** on port 5000  
✅ **OrthogonalRelationshipEdge** loaded for all edge types  
✅ **Waypoint rendering** active  
✅ **Drag handlers** configured  
✅ **Auto-save** enabled  

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Refresh your browser**
2. ✅ **Look for the visible circles** on edges
3. ✅ **Try dragging** a waypoint
4. ✅ **Watch the magic** happen!

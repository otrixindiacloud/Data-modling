## 📝 Key Extractions

### 1. Model Creation Handler
**Before**: 290 lines inline in route  
**After**: Extracted to `model_handlers.ts`  
**Impact**: Route reduced to 10 lines

### 2. System Sync Handler
**Before**: 360 lines inline in route  
**After**: Extracted to `system_sync_handlers.ts`  
**Impact**: Route reduced to 30 lines

### 3. Common Utilities
**Before**: Duplicated across multiple routes  
**After**: Centralized in `route_helpers.ts`  
**Impact**: DRY principle enforced

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### Additional Refactoring Opportunities
- [ ] Extract object creation handler (~530 lines)
- [ ] Extract relationship routes (~540 lines)
- [ ] Extract AI/agent routes (~270 lines)
- [ ] Extract export routes (~170 lines)

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for route handlers
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases

### Architecture
- [ ] Consider splitting routes into feature files
- [ ] Add middleware layer
- [ ] Create response builder utilities
- [ ] Add request validation middleware

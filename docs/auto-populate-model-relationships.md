# Auto-Population of Model Object Relationships

## Overview

When creating a `data_model_object` that references a `data_object` (via `objectId`), the system now automatically creates corresponding relationships in `data_model_object_relationships` based on existing relationships in `data_object_relationships`.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when system-synced objects (objects from external sources with a reference to `data_objects`) were added to a model, their relationships had to be manually created. This led to:
- Inconsistent relationship data between global and model-specific views
- Manual overhead when syncing objects to models
- Potential for missing relationships
- **Orphaned relationships** when objects are removed from models without cleanup

## Solution

The `createDataModelObject` method in `storage.ts` now includes automatic relationship population:

```typescript
async createDataModelObject(object: InsertDataModelObject): Promise<DataModelObject> {
  // ... existing object creation logic ...
  
  // Auto-populate relationships if this is a system-synced object with objectId
  if (created.objectId) {
    await this.autoPopulateModelObjectRelationships(created);
  }
  
  return created;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `autoPopulateModelObjectRelationships`

This private method handles the automatic population of relationships:

1. **Validation**: Checks if the model object has an `objectId` (system-synced objects only)

2. **Layer Context**: Retrieves the layer information (conceptual, logical, or physical) for the model object

3. **Global Relationships**: Fetches all relationships from `data_object_relationships` where the object is either source or target

4. **Model Object Mapping**: Creates a map of `objectId` to `modelObjectId` for all objects in the same model layer

5. **Relationship Processing**: For each global relationship:
   - Checks if both source and target objects exist in the model
   - Verifies the relationship doesn't already exist
   - For attribute-level relationships, maps global attribute IDs to model attribute IDs
   - Creates the corresponding `data_model_object_relationship`

### Relationship Types Supported

#### Object-Level Relationships
Relationships between objects without specific attribute mappings:
```javascript
{
  relationshipLevel: "object",
  sourceModelObjectId: 123,
  targetModelObjectId: 456,
  type: "1:N",
  // sourceAttributeId and targetAttributeId are null
}
```

#### Attribute-Level Relationships
Relationships that involve specific attributes (e.g., foreign key relationships):
```javascript
{
  relationshipLevel: "attribute",
  sourceModelObjectId: 123,
  targetModelObjectId: 456,
  sourceAttributeId: 789,  // References data_model_object_attributes.id
  targetAttributeId: 101,   // References data_model_object_attributes.id
  type: "1:N"
}
```

## Workflow Example

### Before Auto-Population
```
1. Create data_object in global catalog
2. Create relationships in data_object_relationships
3. Add data_object to a model → creates data_model_object
4. MANUAL: Create relationships in data_model_object_relationships
```

### After Auto-Population
```
1. Create data_object in global catalog
2. Create relationships in data_object_relationships
3. Add data_object to a model → creates data_model_object
4. AUTOMATIC: Relationships are created in data_model_object_relationships
```

## Logging and Debugging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

```
[STORAGE] Auto-populating relationships for model object 123 (objectId: 456)
[STORAGE] Found 5 data object relationships to process
[STORAGE] Created model relationship: 123 -> 789 (1:N)
[STORAGE] Skipping attribute relationship - model attributes not found...
[STORAGE] Relationship auto-population complete: 4 created, 1 skipped
```

## Scenarios Handled

### ✅ Successful Scenarios

1. **Both Objects Present**: Source and target objects both exist in the model
   - Relationship is created automatically

2. **Multiple Relationships**: Object has relationships with multiple other objects
   - All applicable relationships are created

3. **Mixed Relationship Levels**: Object has both object-level and attribute-level relationships
   - Both types are handled appropriately

4. **Existing Relationships**: Relationship already exists in the model
   - Skipped to avoid duplicates

### ⏭️ Skipped Scenarios

1. **Missing Target**: Target object doesn't exist in the model yet
   - Skipped (will be created when target is added)

2. **Missing Source**: Source object doesn't exist in the model
   - Skipped (unlikely since we just created the source)

3. **Missing Attributes**: Attribute-level relationship but model attributes not found
   - Skipped with informative log message

4. **User-Created Objects**: Model object with `objectId = null`
   - Not processed (no global relationships to sync)

## Database Schema

### Tables Involved

```sql
-- Global relationships (system catalog)
data_object_relationships
├── id
├── sourceDataObjectId (→ data_objects.id)
├── targetDataObjectId (→ data_objects.id)
├── relationshipLevel ('object' | 'attribute')
├── sourceAttributeId (→ attributes.id, nullable)
├── targetAttributeId (→ attributes.id, nullable)
└── type ('1:1' | '1:N' | 'N:M')

-- Model-specific relationships
data_model_object_relationships
├── id
├── sourceModelObjectId (→ data_model_objects.id)
├── targetModelObjectId (→ data_model_objects.id)
├── relationshipLevel ('object' | 'attribute')
├── sourceAttributeId (→ data_model_object_attributes.id, nullable)
├── targetAttributeId (→ data_model_object_attributes.id, nullable)
├── modelId (→ data_model_layers.id)
├── layer ('conceptual' | 'logical' | 'physical')
└── type ('1:1' | '1:N' | 'N:M')
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Model relationships automatically reflect global relationships
2. **Efficiency**: No manual relationship creation needed
3. **Accuracy**: Reduces human error in relationship mapping
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for object relationships
5. **Traceability**: Clear logging of what was created/skipped

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Batch Processing**: When multiple objects are added at once, create relationships in batch
2. **Relationship Updates**: Auto-update model relationships when global relationships change
3. **Cascading Deletion**: Remove model relationships when global relationships are deleted
4. **Relationship Validation**: Validate relationship types and cardinality
5. **Cross-Layer Relationships**: Handle relationships across different model layers

## Orphaned Relationship Cleanup

### Problem

When model objects are deleted or removed from layers, their relationships may remain in the database, causing:
- "MISSING" object warnings in logs
- Confusion about which relationships are valid
- Performance issues with large numbers of invalid relationships

### Solution: Automatic Cleanup

The system now includes automatic cleanup functionality:

#### 1. Automatic Cleanup on Canvas Load

Every time canvas data is fetched (`GET /api/models/:id/canvas`), the system automatically:
- Checks all relationships in the layer
- Identifies relationships where source or target objects no longer exist
- Removes orphaned relationships
- Logs the cleanup activity

```typescript
// Automatically called before loading canvas
await storage.cleanupOrphanedRelationships(layerId);
```

#### 2. Manual Cleanup Endpoint

For administrative purposes, you can manually trigger cleanup:

```http
POST /api/models/:modelId/relationships/cleanup
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cleaned up 50 orphaned relationships",
  "deleted": 50
}
```

### Cleanup Process

1. **Fetch Relationships**: Get all relationships in the specified model layer
2. **Validate Objects**: Check if both source and target model objects exist
3. **Identify Orphans**: Mark relationships where either object is missing
4. **Delete**: Remove orphaned relationships from the database
5. **Log Results**: Report how many were deleted

### Logging Example

```
[STORAGE] Cleaning up orphaned relationships for model 6
[STORAGE] Found 51 relationships to check
[STORAGE] Found 2 valid model objects in layer
[STORAGE] Found orphaned relationship 58: source 134 (MISSING), target 133 (MISSING)
[STORAGE] Found orphaned relationship 57: source 134 (MISSING), target 133 (MISSING)
...
[STORAGE] Deleted 50 orphaned relationships
```

### When Cleanup Runs

- ✅ **Automatically**: Every time canvas is loaded
- ✅ **Manually**: Via cleanup endpoint
- ✅ **Preventively**: During object creation (validation prevents creation of invalid relationships)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Batch Processing**: When multiple objects are added at once, create relationships in batch
2. **Relationship Updates**: Auto-update model relationships when global relationships change
3. **Cascading Deletion**: Remove model relationships when global relationships are deleted
4. **Relationship Validation**: Validate relationship types and cardinality
5. **Cross-Layer Relationships**: Handle relationships across different model layers

## API Impact

This change is **transparent** to API consumers:
- No API changes required
- Existing `POST /api/objects` endpoint behavior enhanced
- No breaking changes

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the feature works correctly:

1. **Create Test Objects**: Create 2-3 data objects with relationships
2. **Add to Model**: Add these objects to a model layer
3. **Verify Relationships**: Check that `data_model_object_relationships` contains expected entries
4. **Check Logs**: Review console logs for relationship creation messages
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Try scenarios with missing objects, existing relationships, etc.

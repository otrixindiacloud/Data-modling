## ✅ Node Connection Points

### **12 Connection Points Per Node**

Each node now has **12 connection handles** distributed evenly across all 4 sides:

- **Top**: 3 handles at 25%, 50%, 75% positions
- **Bottom**: 3 handles at 25%, 50%, 75% positions  
- **Left**: 3 handles at 25%, 50%, 75% vertical positions
- **Right**: 3 handles at 25%, 50%, 75% vertical positions

### **Handle Specifications**
- **Size**: 2px × 2px (8px total with border)
- **Styling**: 
  - Primary color background
  - 2px white border
  - Drop shadow for visibility
  - Hover effect: 150% scale
  - Smooth transitions
- **Position**: 4px offset from node edge
- **IDs**: 
  - `top-1`, `top-2`, `top-3`
  - `bottom-1`, `bottom-2`, `bottom-3`
  - `left-1`, `left-2`, `left-3`
  - `right-1`, `right-2`, `right-3`

### **Benefits**
✅ Multiple connection options per side
✅ Cleaner edge routing (avoids overlapping)
✅ More flexible relationship layouts
✅ Better visual organization for complex models

## ✅ Relationship Edge Waypoints

### **Draggable Control Points**

Every relationship edge has **1-2 draggable waypoints** for path adjustment:

- **Minimum**: 1 waypoint (auto-generated if none exist)
- **Maximum**: 2 waypoints (enforced via `.slice(0, 2)`)
- **Auto-generation**: Creates 2 default waypoints at midpoint for clean routing

### **Waypoint Specifications**
- **Size**: 
  - Normal: 5px radius
  - Hover: 6px radius
  - Dragging: 7px radius
- **Styling**:
  - White fill (color fill when dragging)
  - 2px colored border matching relationship type
  - Inner dot (2px radius) for visual feedback
  - Drop shadow for depth
  - Smooth transitions (0.2s)
- **Cursor**: 
  - `grab` on hover
  - `grabbing` when dragging

### **Drag Behavior**

#### **First Waypoint (closer to source)**
- Determines path direction based on mouse movement
- If dragging more horizontally → snaps to source's Y-axis
- If dragging more vertically → snaps to source's X-axis
- Automatically adjusts second waypoint to maintain 90° angles

#### **Second Waypoint (closer to target)**
- Constrained movement to maintain orthogonal path
- If first waypoint is horizontal from source → second moves only vertically
- If first waypoint is vertical from source → second moves only horizontally
- Always creates perfect 90-degree turn from first waypoint

### **Path Structure**
```
Source Node → Waypoint 1 (H or V) → Waypoint 2 (perpendicular) → Target Node
```

### **Benefits**
✅ Always maintains 90-degree angles (no diagonal segments)
✅ Smooth drag without jumping
✅ Intelligent constraint system
✅ Auto-saves to database on drag end
✅ Smaller, less intrusive visual design

## ✅ Relationship Type Visual Indicators

### **"Many" Relationship (1:N, N:1, N:M)**

Shows **3 parallel lines** perpendicular to the edge at the target end:

- **Position**: 20px before target node
- **Line Length**: 12px
- **Spacing**: 4px between lines
- **Stroke Width**: 2.5px
- **Color**: Matches relationship type color
- **Line Cap**: Rounded for clean appearance

### **"One" Relationship (1:1)**

Shows **1 single line** perpendicular to the edge at the target end:

- **Position**: 20px before target node
- **Line Length**: 12px
- **Stroke Width**: 2.5px
- **Color**: Matches relationship type color
- **Line Cap**: Rounded for clean appearance

### **Indicator Calculation**
- Automatically calculates edge direction from path
- Positions perpendicular to edge direction
- Works with any edge orientation (horizontal, vertical, or angled)
- Dynamic calculation based on last path segment

### **Benefits**
✅ Clear visual distinction between relationship types
✅ No text labels cluttering the diagram
✅ International/language-agnostic visualization
✅ Professional database modeling appearance

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified**

1. **`/client/src/components/nodes/DataObjectNode.tsx`**
   - Added 12 connection handles (3 per side)
   - Reduced handle size for cleaner appearance
   - Positioned handles at 25%, 50%, 75% intervals

2. **`/client/src/components/edges/OrthogonalRelationshipEdge.tsx`**
   - Implemented constrained waypoint dragging
   - Reduced waypoint size (5px-7px radius)
   - Added 3-line indicator for "many" relationships
   - Added 1-line indicator for "one" relationships
   - Removed text labels (1:N, etc.)
   - Fixed drag event handling on parent group
   - Ensured 90-degree angle maintenance

### **Key Functions**

#### **`getOrthogonalPath()`**
- Generates path with automatic waypoint creation
- Limits waypoints to maximum 2
- Creates 90-degree angle routing
- Returns: `[path, labelX, labelY, draggableWaypoints]`

#### **`handleWaypointDrag()`**
- Constrains waypoint movement to maintain orthogonal angles
- First waypoint: free movement with direction detection
- Second waypoint: constrained to one axis
- Updates edge data in ReactFlow state

#### **Visual Indicator Rendering**
- Parses SVG path to get last segment
- Calculates direction and perpendicular vectors
- Positions 3 lines (many) or 1 line (one) accordingly
- Matches relationship type color

## 🔄 Coordinate System

### **Screen-to-Canvas Conversion**
```typescript
const screenToCanvas = (screenX: number, screenY: number) => {
  return {
    x: (screenX - offsetX) / zoomLevel,
    y: (screenY - offsetY) / zoomLevel,
  };
};
```

Accounts for:
- Zoom level (scale)
- Pan offset (x, y translation)
- Ensures waypoints stay fixed to canvas coordinates

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### **Database Storage**
- Waypoints stored in `data_model_object_relationships.metadata` JSONB column
- Format: `{ waypoints: [{ x: number, y: number }, ...] }`
- Auto-saves on `handleWaypointDragEnd`
- Validated via Zod schema in `validation_schemas.ts`

### **API Endpoint**
- `PUT /api/data-models/:modelId/relationships/:relationshipId`
- Accepts `waypoints` array in request body
- Updates metadata field in PostgreSQL

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Node Connections**
- [ ] Verify all 12 handles are visible on each node
- [ ] Test connecting from each handle position
- [ ] Verify handles respond to hover (scale effect)
- [ ] Test connections at different zoom levels

### **Waypoint Dragging**
- [ ] Drag first waypoint horizontally - should snap to source Y
- [ ] Drag first waypoint vertically - should snap to source X
- [ ] Drag second waypoint - should stay on one axis
- [ ] Verify no diagonal segments appear
- [ ] Test at different zoom levels
- [ ] Verify waypoints persist after save

### **Visual Indicators**
- [ ] 1:N relationship shows 3 parallel lines at target
- [ ] 1:1 relationship shows 1 line at target
- [ ] N:M relationship shows 3 parallel lines at target
- [ ] Indicators positioned correctly on all edge orientations
- [ ] Indicators match relationship type color

### **General**
- [ ] Edge paths maintain 90-degree angles always
- [ ] Waypoints are small but visible
- [ ] Drag operations are smooth without jumping
- [ ] Multiple edges don't overlap (use different handles)
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with many edges

## 📊 Visual Comparison

### **Before**
- 4 connection points per node
- 8-10px waypoints (too large)
- Text labels "1:N" cluttering edges
- Arrow markers on edge ends
- Free waypoint movement (breaking 90° rule)

### **After**
- 12 connection points per node (3 per side)
- 5-7px waypoints (smaller, cleaner)
- 3 lines for "many", 1 line for "one" (clear visual)
- No arrow markers (cleaner appearance)
- Constrained waypoint movement (maintains 90° always)

---

## 🚀 User Experience

### **Creating Connections**
1. Hover over node to see all 12 connection handles
2. Drag from any handle to any target handle
3. Edge automatically creates with 2 waypoints
4. Path maintains 90-degree angles

### **Adjusting Paths**
1. See 2 small visible waypoint circles on edge
2. Hover over waypoint (grows slightly)
3. Drag to adjust path
4. First waypoint moves freely (second adjusts)
5. Second waypoint constrained to maintain 90° angles
6. Release to auto-save

### **Understanding Relationships**
- **3 parallel lines at end** = "Many" relationship (1:N, N:1, N:M)
- **1 line at end** = "One" relationship (1:1)
- No text labels needed
- Clean, professional appearance

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add grid snapping for waypoints (align to grid)
- [ ] Show temporary guide lines during drag
- [ ] Keyboard modifiers (Shift to override constraints)
- [ ] Add/remove waypoint controls (if needed beyond 1-2)
- [ ] Angle indicator overlay (visual 90° confirmation)
- [ ] Undo/redo for waypoint adjustments
- [ ] Waypoint position presets (straight, L-shape, Z-shape)

---

## 📝 Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Existing edges will auto-generate waypoints on first render
- Database schema unchanged (uses existing metadata field)
- TypeScript types updated for waypoint arrays
- ReactFlow v11 compatible

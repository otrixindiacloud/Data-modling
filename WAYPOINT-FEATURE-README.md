# 🎯 Waypoint Feature - Ready to Use!

## What's New?

You can now **add turning points to edges** and drag them to create custom paths! This gives you complete control over how relationship edges flow through your diagram.

## Quick Demo

### ➕ Add Waypoint
1. **Hover** over any edge
2. **Double-click** the small circle that appears
3. **New turning point** is added!

```
Before:                After:
┌────┐                ┌────┐
│ A  │─────┐          │ A  │──●──┐
└────┘     │          └────┘     │
      ┌────▼               ┌─────▼
      │ B  │               │ B   │
      └────┘               └─────┘
```

### 🎯 Move Waypoint
1. **Click and hold** a waypoint (white circle)
2. **Drag** to new position
3. **Release** to save

### ❌ Remove Waypoint
1. **Select** the edge
2. **Click** the red X button on waypoint
3. Waypoint is removed!

## Features

✅ **Double-click edge** to add waypoint  
✅ **Drag waypoints** to adjust path  
✅ **Click X** to remove waypoint  
✅ **90-degree angles** maintained  
✅ **Auto-save** - changes persist  
✅ **Works at any zoom level**  

## Visual Guide

### What You'll See

When you **hover** over an edge:
- Small circles (⊕) appear at segment midpoints
- Double-click these to add waypoints

When you **select** an edge:
- Waypoints show as white circles (●)
- Grip icon inside circle
- Red X button for removal

When you **drag** a waypoint:
- Path updates in real-time
- Maintains 90-degree angles
- Smooth animation

## Try It Now!

Your server is already running at **http://localhost:5000**

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:5000
2. Create or view a relationship between nodes
3. Hover over the edge
4. Double-click to add a waypoint
5. Drag the waypoint to customize the path!

## Use Cases

### 1. Route Around Obstacles
```
Problem: Edge goes through nodes
Solution: Add waypoints to route around
```

### 2. Organize Parallel Edges
```
Problem: Multiple edges overlap
Solution: Add waypoints to separate them
```

### 3. Show Data Flow Direction
```
Problem: Flow unclear
Solution: Use waypoints to emphasize direction
```

## What Changed

### Enhanced Components
- **OrthogonalRelationshipEdge.tsx** - Added waypoint add/remove/drag functionality
- Improved coordinate handling for accurate positioning
- Better visual feedback and interaction

### Key Improvements
1. **Add waypoints** via double-click
2. **Remove waypoints** via X button
3. **Better drag handling** with screen-to-canvas coordinate conversion
4. **Visual feedback** with hover states and animations

### Database
No schema changes needed! Waypoints are stored in the existing `metadata` field.

## Pro Tips

💡 **Keep it simple** - Use 2-3 waypoints max per edge  
💡 **Align waypoints** - Use grid snapping for cleaner paths  
💡 **Test zoom levels** - Make sure paths look good zoomed out  
💡 **Remove unnecessary** - Clean up waypoints you don't need  

## Keyboard & Mouse

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Hover edge | Shows add-waypoint buttons |
| Double-click segment | Adds waypoint |
| Click + Drag waypoint | Moves waypoint |
| Click X button | Removes waypoint |
| Select edge | Shows all controls |

## Troubleshooting

### Waypoint won't drag?
- Make sure edge is selected first (click on it)
- Not in connection mode

### Can't add waypoint?
- Look for small circles when hovering
- Double-click (not single)

### Changes not saving?
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure database connection is working
